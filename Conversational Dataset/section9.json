        "Tutorbot": "Modules in Python are files containing Python code, typically consisting of functions, classes, and variables. They allow you to organize and reuse code by breaking it into separate files. Modules are imported into other Python scripts or modules using the 'import' statement."

        "Tutorbot": "A package in Python is a collection of related modules organized into directories. Packages allow you to hierarchically structure your code and avoid naming conflicts. They typically contain an '__init__.py' file to indicate that the directory should be treated as a package."

        "Tutorbot": "To create a package in Python, you can simply create a directory and place Python modules inside it. Additionally, you can include an '__init__.py' file in the directory to indicate that it should be treated as a package. Subdirectories can also be included to create a hierarchical structure."

        "Tutorbot": "The 'import module' statement imports the entire module namespace into the current namespace, requiring you to prefix symbols with the module name. The 'from module import *' statement imports all symbols from the module into the current namespace directly, allowing you to use them without prefixing."

Optionally, you can specify the version of the package to install or use a requirements file to install multiple packages at once."
