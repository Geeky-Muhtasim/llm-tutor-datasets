Code that might raise an exception is placed inside the 'try' block, and code to handle the exception is placed inside the 'except' block. If an exception occurs within the 'try' block, control is transferred to the corresponding 'except' block for handling."

The 'finally' block is typically used for releasing resources or closing files."
