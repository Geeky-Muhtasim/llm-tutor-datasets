        "Tutorbot": "In Python functions, parameters are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They are placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function when it is called. Arguments, on the other hand, are the actual values passed into the function when it is called."

        "Tutorbot": "To call a function in Python, you simply use the function name followed by parentheses containing any arguments you want to pass to the function. For example, 'my_function(arg1, arg2)' would call the function 'my_function' with arguments 'arg1' and 'arg2'."

        "Subproblem": "Explain what a return statement does in Python functions.",
        "Tutorbot": "A return statement in Python functions is used to exit the function and optionally return a value to the caller. It allows the function to pass data back to the calling code. Once a return statement is encountered, the function execution stops, and control is returned to the caller."

        "Tutorbot": "Scope in Python functions refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within the code. Variables defined inside a function are scoped to that function and are not accessible outside of it unless explicitly declared as global. Variables defined outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code."

        "Tutorbot": "A docstring in Python is a string literal used to document a function, module, class, or method. It is enclosed in triple quotes and appears as the first statement in the function body. Docstrings serve as documentation for the code and are accessible via the help() function or doc attribute."

        "Subproblem": "Explain what default arguments are and how they work in Python functions.",
        "Tutorbot": "Default arguments in Python functions are parameters that have default values assigned to them. If a value is not provided for these parameters when the function is called, the default value is used instead. Default arguments allow for more flexibility when calling functions."

        "Tutorbot": "A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function defined using the 'lambda' keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are often used as inline functions where a small piece of functionality is required."
